# LanguageAnalysis

This is a set of statistics, primarily on Norwegian languages. This is completely based on the work from [Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/about/organization/text-laboratory/services/nowac-frequency.html) at [The University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no). But we aim to present this in a more accessible manner.
